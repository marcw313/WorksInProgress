					<p><b>IF I'M NOT OFF CHASING ONE OF MY DREAMS (FEEL FREE TO ASK ME ABOUT ANY OF THEM), YOU CAN USUALLY FIND ME EITHER LEARNING A NEW SKILL, COOKING SOMETHING NEW (AND HOPEFULLY DELICIOUS) IN THE KITCHEN, OR ENGROSSED IN SOME SORT OF STORY FROM HISTORY. IT'S ALSO NOT UNCOMMON FOR ME TO TELL YOU ALL ABOUT WHY &lt; <span style="font-family:Garamond; display:inline-block;">insert movie here</span> &gt; WAS SO GREAT -- OR SOMETIMES TERRIBLE -- AND THEN BITE MY TONGUE WHEN YOU DISAGREE.

					<p class = "moreRoom2">As a Software Assets Management Consultant, I analyze client data to understand deficiencies in their software licensing to help them understand their license agreements as well as for audit preparation and support. I've supported clients during audits by creating, editing, and supporting SQL scripts, ranging from simple to highly complex, in order to obtain software data from client environments in multiple query languages such as SQL Server, PL/SQL, and MySQL. Finally, I automate data analysis algorithms used by other consultants and analysts to ensure timely delivery of services and analyses.</p>

					<p>In one of the best opportunities I received during my college career, I learned how analytics solutions teams work in large corporations. My team and I created a custom analytics dashboard using Tableau software to analyze how employees were spending their time at work. How well were employees utilized, which projects were they working on, and for upoming projects, which employees were assigned to the projects. We also performed market research on big data tools, such as Hadoop, Cassandra, D3.js, and startups employing big data.</p>
